<h3>Is GOA boring?</h3>
<p>No!GOA isn't boring.learning in GOA is fun.there are a lot of things that makes GOA more interesting. one very cool thing is that you can start working here. for example you can be a mini leader(a person who helps the leader. leader is the person who helps students who can't do their homework,and they explain to students how to do it and how it works.) while you're attending the lesson,one person(not a student of course)is writing down if you attended the lesson,if you had your camera turned on,if you did your classwork correctly and so on.and at the end of the lesson,acording to these information,the teacher says who was the best stundent that day.the person who was the best student gets a badge next to his/her name.the student has to be the best student next lesson if he/she wants to keep his/her badge.thats fun.isn't it?</p>
