        <p>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the three main building blocks of websites.<br>

            HTML is like the skeleton of a webpage. It tells the computer what content to show, like text, images, and links. Think of it as the structure of a house: the walls, windows, and doors.

            CSS is like the paint and decoration on the walls of that house. It makes the website look nice by adding colors, fonts, and arranging things in a way thats easy to read and navigate. Without CSS, websites would just be plain text and images.

            JavaScript is what makes a website interactive. It allows things to move or change on the page without refreshing it. For example, when you click a button to open a menu or submit a form, JavaScript is working behind the scenes to make that happen. <p>Click the link to know more information about Javascript -> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript"> go to  site about Java script </a></p><br>
            Together, these three tools work to create websites that are not only functional but also attractive and interactive!</p>
