      <h1>the Battle of Didgori</h1> 
      <p>In the 12th century, Georgia was ruled by Queen <b>Tamar</b>,one of the most famous and loved leaders in Georgian history. This time is called <b><i>The Golden Age </i></b>because Georgia became strong, rich, and respected by other countries.</p><br>
      <p>Before Queen Tamars rule, Georgia won a very important battle called the <b> Battle of Didgori </b>in <b>1121.</b> This battle happened during the time of her father, King <b>David IV, </b> also known as David the Builder. The King wanted to free Georgian lands from invaders. A huge army from the <b>Seljuk Empire </b>came to fight against Georgia.</p>

      <p>The Georgian army was much smaller than the Seljuk army, but they were very brave and smart. King David used clever strategies to surprise the enemy. The Georgians attacked suddenly, and the Seljuk army was defeated. This victory was so important because it made Georgia stronger and helped King David unite the country.</p><br>
      <p>Later, under Queen Tamars rule, Georgia became one of the most <b>powerful</b> kingdoms in the region. The people built <i>beautiful churches, </i>wrote <b>poems </b>and created <b>amazing art </b>that is still admired today.</p><br>

      <p>Even now, Georgians remember the Battle of Didgori as one of the greatest victories in their history. It is called the <i>“Miracle of Didgori” </i>and shows how brave and clever the Georgian people were.</p>
